    "## Writing Functions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "The goal of this course is to transform you into a Python expert, and so the first chapter starts off with best practices when writing functions. You'll cover docstrings and why they matter and how to know when you need to turn a chunk of code into a function. You will also learn the details of how Python passes arguments to functions, as well as some common gotchas that can cause debugging headaches when calling functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DocStrings\n",
    "* The first function you write is **count_letter()**. It takes a string and a single letter and returns the number of times the letter appears in the string. You want the users of your open-source package to be able to understand how this function works easily, so you will need to give it a docstring. Build up a Google Style docstring for this function by following these steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def count_letter(content, letter):\n",
    "  \"\"\"Count the number of times `letter` appears in `content`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Args:\n",
    "    content (str): The string to search.\n",
    "    letter (str): The letter to search for.\n",

    "  Returns:\n",
    "    int\n",

    "  # Add a section detailing what errors might be raised\n",
    "  Raises:\n",
    "    ValueError: If `letter` is not a one-character string.\n",

    "  if (not isinstance(letter, str)) or len(letter) != 1:\n",
    "    raise ValueError('`letter` must be a single character string.')\n",
    "  return len([char for char in content if char == letter])\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Retrieving docstrings\n",
    "You and a group of friends are working on building an amazing new Python IDE (integrated development environment -- like PyCharm, Spyder, Eclipse, Visual Studio, etc.). The team wants to add a feature that displays a tooltip with a function's docstring whenever the user starts typing the function name. That way, the user doesn't have to go elsewhere to look up the documentation for the function they are trying to use. You've been asked to complete the build_tooltip() function that retrieves a docstring from an arbitrary function.\n",

Something weird is happening with the data being returned from one of your functions, but you're not even sure which function is causing the trouble.

For instance, if you expect a function to return a numpy array, but it returns a list, you can get unexpected behavior. To ensure this is not what is causing the trouble, you decide to write a decorator, print_return_type(), that will print out the type of the variable that gets returned from every call of any function it is decorating."

    "Python's flexibility around data types is usually cited as one of the benefits of the language. It can sometimes cause problems though if incorrect data types go unnoticed. You've decided that in order to ensure your code is doing exactly what you want it to do, you will explicitly check the return types in all of your functions and make sure they're returning what you expect. To do that, you are going to create a decorator that checks if the return type of the decorated function is correct.\n",
