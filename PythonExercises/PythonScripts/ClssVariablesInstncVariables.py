# graph becomes a class variable that is bound to a function/method object. p1.graph() is evaluated by:
#   looking up p1 and finding that it’s an instance of Point
#   looking for an instance variable called graph in p1, but not finding one
#   looking for a class variable called graph in p1’s class, the Point class; it finds a function/method object
#   Because of the () after the word graph, it invokes the function/method object, with the parameter self bound to the object p1 points to.
