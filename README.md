## Python Code / Short Project Samples 🐍
* Please see the section details below for various **python** use case samples displaying a host of recently completed tasks, short projects, and course material 

<br>

### **PIL Image Library / Contact Sheet** 🖼️
* This brief project was part of the final capstone project for the **Python Specialization** Coursera offers in tandem with the University of Michigan
* Within the Jupyter Notebook, the progression and task completion can be reviewed for building a contact sheet with a provided image
* The tasks use modules of the `PIL` Imaging Library to complete tasks such as 
    * Concatenating and dynamically adding multilple PIL image instances to a parent contact sheet
    * Drawing and Writing text to the modified images for the various channels
    * Channel setting and usage of PIL instance properties like .point to modify per the assingment rubric
* [Contact Sheet Notebook](/PyImaging/Contact%20Sheet%20-%20PIL.ipynb)

### **PyTesseract (Image & Text Recognition)** 📷 📰
* The Final project for the Specialization  challenged us to use various libraries [**PIL**, **Pytesseract**, **CV (detection classifier)**] to extract faces from a zipped file of text files (newspapers)
* Tasks included 
    * Iterating through zipped file and subsequent classification with pytesseract (ocr)
    * MultiScale face detection and gray scale conversion with stated libraries above
    * Facial recognition (bounding boxes) extraction for "facial" image recognition 
    * Contact Sheet Creation

### **Data Analysis - Confidence Intervals**
* What contributes to the success of Disney Movies?
* In the following notebook, the following items are evaluated to gain a better perspective


<br>

### **Data Viz - Plotly (Callback/HTML)**
* This project uses `Dash` and `Plotly` (dash application) to vizualize in a **tree-like** visualization for the grouped by choices from the two drop-down buttons
* The project shows 
    * Pandas / Python methods for data generation
    * HTML / Dash (App) callback elements
    * Plotly (express) method calls
